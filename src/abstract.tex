This is a proposal for a method that calculates vehicle's license plate
approximate
localization in video using convolutional neural networks applied directly to
the value of the RGB pixels. During the training some random distortions are
added to the images, such as adding noise and changing image's brightness,
contrast and saturation, to produce a robust model, even when used without any
filter or normalization. This proposal includes a method for efficient image
partitioning, in such a way that the number times the neural network have to be
applied is considerably reduced. Measured precision was 98.7\% and recall was
96.7\% for locating licence plates with error smaller than $60\text{px} \times
20\text{px}$.
