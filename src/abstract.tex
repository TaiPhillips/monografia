License plate extraction is an important component of contemporary's urban
traffic control and surveillance systems. 
Some systems include extraction as an important part of one of it's
sub-components.
In some cases the extraction performance characteristics may be determinant
of the whole system viability.
This is a proposal for a method that obtains the approximate location of
vehicle's license plates
in a video using convolutional neural networks applied directly to
the value of the RGB pixels.
In the implementation being presented the vehicle's license plate position can
be determined with an error margin smaller than $ \pm 20 \times \pm 60 $
pixels. During the training, some random distortions are
added to the images, such as noise and changing the image's brightness,
contrast and saturation, to produce a robust model, even when used without any
filter or normalization. This proposal includes a method for efficient image
partitioning, in such a way that the number of times the neural network has to
be applied is considerably reduced.
Measured precision was 98.9\% and recall was 96.7\% for locating license
plates while processing each $480 \times 768$ frame in 67.6ms on
a Core i5 notebook with a GTX 750M GPU.
